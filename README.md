__Age group__

The patient age column contains numerous ages which were grouped for simplicity and understanding as follows;

- < 1yr = Infant.

- 65yrs and above = Older adult.

## CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
***
â€¢	Data on satisfaction score and reason(s) behind satisfaction score filled should be collected from discharged patients. This will help to uncover the root cause of the score filled.

â€¢	Measures to reduce patients wait-time should also be put in place, this might help to improve patient satisfaction score also.

â€¢	Data on hospital location and location of the patients should be collected. This will further help to study and analyze how KPI varies among locations.

â€¢	The reason(s) why no patient was admitted for the first 3 months of the year 2019 into the hospital should be investigated as well.
